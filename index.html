        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm Joseph Toloso — a U.S. Air Force Air National Guard veteran and mission-driven Cybersecurity Analyst currently supporting national defense initiatives at the Pentagon. Over the past several years, I’ve operated across multiple combatant commands including CENTCOM (AOR), PACAF, and USAFE, gaining hands-on experience in cybersecurity operations, systems administration, vulnerability management, and SATCOM deployment.</p>

<p>During my tour in the AOR, I led efforts to streamline and automate IT processes using PowerShell, including building custom scripts to manage patching and system health checks when traditional tools like MCM and Software Center were unavailable. I also headed the vulnerability management team, often executing patching manually in high-pressure, resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>In PACAF, I managed and executed all ACAS vulnerability scans across the enterprise and successfully architected and deployed a SolarWinds monitoring solution to improve network visibility and incident response.

<p>While supporting USAFE, I built and deployed three Splunk servers from the ground up, creating custom dashboards that provided real-time visibility into failed logins, asset inventory breakdowns, and geolocation of devices based on naming conventions and embedded coordinate lookups.</p>

<p>Now, as a Cybersecurity Analyst at the Pentagon, I conduct Security Assessment and Validation (SAV), CCRI/CORA inspections, and support organizations in achieving and maintaining Authorization to Operate (ATO) under the RMF process. My day-to-day includes leveraging Splunk, Trellix, and eMASS to secure critical infrastructure and mentor teams through compliance efforts.</p>

<p>With a background that bridges tactical deployment and enterprise cyber defense, I’m passionate about blue team operations, automation, and continuing to grow in the cybersecurity domain. I hold the CASP+, Security+, and AZ-500 certifications, and I’m currently pursuing the Splunk Core Certified Power User and Certified Cyber Defender (CCD) certifications.</p>
